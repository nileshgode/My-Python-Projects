This dataset has also been labeled, with each possible ad given a label that says whether it is actually an advertisement or not. **Using this dataset, you have to build a model that predicts whether something is an advertisement or not.** You may think that this is a relatively simple problem that could be solved with any binary classification algorithm.

Each principal component will be in an axis that is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the other principal component. If a second principal component was generated for the preceding example, the second principal component would be along an axis indicated by the blue arrow in the graph. The way we pick the number of principal components for model building is by selecting the number of components that explains a certain threshold of variability.\n",
